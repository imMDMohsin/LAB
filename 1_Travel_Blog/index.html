        <p>My journey began in the labyrinthine district of Old Delhi. The moment I entered its narrow, bustling
            streets, I was transported back in time. The Red Fort, with its grandeur and intricate details, left me in
            awe of the Mughal era's architectural brilliance. As I wandered through the busy alleys, the Jama Masjid's
